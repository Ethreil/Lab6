	 *
	 * One unique property of circles is that they do not share same complexity. As such, the circumference of a
	 * circle can be calculated more simply and precisely. Thus, the circle class overwrite the getPerimeter method.
	 * This will give a result that is more accurate than the getPerimeter implemented in ellipse and that is generally
	 * simpler.
	 *
	 * getArea() is not overwritten, as the formula is equivalent and equally precise/easy for ellipses and circles.
