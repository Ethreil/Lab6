	/**
	 * Implementation of the compareTo method derived from "implements Comparable<Shape>"
	 * The Comparable interface is used to define the "natural ordering" of classes. That is,
	 * the default way to sort objects of a class. If we want to sort a list of shapes, Java has
	 * no way to know inherently if one shape should come before or after another shape. Thus, we use
	 * Comparable to tell Java how to sort a list.
	 *
	 * It is possible to define other ordering or provide a way to compare objects without the comparable
	 * interface as well. This is demonstrated with the ShapeAreaComparator and ShapePerimeterComparator,
	 * which define an alternate orderings for shapes. This is demonstrated in the driver and the ShapeSorter
	 * classes. Sorting is done by:
	 * 	(a) The Shape class's "Natural Order". i.e. it's compareTo method.
	 * 	(b) An alternate order, as defined by the ShapeAreaComparator and ShapePerimeterComparator classes.
	 * If no explicit comparator is given to a sorting function, then the default is to use the compareTo function
	 * from the comparable interface, if it is overwritten.
	 *
	 * For this compareTo, we compare area and perimeter to determine how to sort, but in general any property
	 * of the object could be used. By convention, when comparing two objects, a comparison
	 * should return -1 if the first object in the comparison should come before the second object
	 * in a sorted list, 0 if they are effectively equal, and 1 if the first object should
	 * come after the second object in a sorted list. A comparison may sort elements in ascending
	 * order, but may be defined to sort data in any way.
	 *
	 * This compareTo orders shapes by area and perimeter. If a shape has a larger area, it should
	 * be ordered to come after the shape it is compared to in a sorted list. If the areas are equal,
	 * the shape with the smaller perimeter comes first. A list of shapes is thus sorted in ascending
	 * order of area/perimeter when using Shape's compareTo.
	 *
     * E.g. we have the shapes A, B, and C. A has a larger area than B and an equal area to C.
     * A also has a smaller perimeter than C.
     *  A.compareTo(B) yields 1 to indicate that it should come after B in a sorted list. This is because
     *  we define that shapes with larger areas (A) should be placed after shapes with smaller areas (B).
     *  A.compareTo(C) yields -1 to indicate that it should come before C in a sorted list. This is because
     *  the areas are equal, but we define that shapes with larger perimeters (A) should be placed before
     *  shapes with smaller perimeters (C).
     * Thus, the when using compareTo to sort, a list will be sorted as such:
     *
     * B A C
	 *
	 * @return -1, 0, or 1. These values are returned on the following conditions:
	 *     (this refers to this Shape object, and s refers to the input parameter Shape s)
	 *     (1) Area of this is > Area of s: return 1 (this should come after s in a sorted list)
	 *     (2) Area of this is < Area of s: return -1 (this should come before s in a sorted list)
	 *     (3) Area of this = Area of s:
	 *         (a) Perimeter of this is > Perimeter of s: return 1 (this should come after s in a sorted list)
	 *         (b) Perimeter of this is < Perimeter of s: return -1 (this should come before s in a sorted list)
	 *         (C) Perimeter of this = Perimeter of s: return 0 (this is effecitively equal to s in a sorted list)

	 * Note that these are abstract methods in Shape and are thus not implemented here. Instead,
	 * when you call getShapeType() in this method, it will use the getShapeType() method as
	 * implemented in the non-abstract shape that the toString() is called on.
	 *
	 * E.g. you call toString() on a Square. The Square does not have its own toString, so it looks
	 * for a toString of one of its superclasses. Shape is the first superclass of Square that has
	 * a toString, so the toString of Shape is used. getShapeType() is overriden and implemented in Square,
